Student academic performance is affected by various factors. The following analysis aims to get insights on the student academic performance based on various factors such as gender, race/ethnicity, parental education levels, type of lunch etc. The analysis is mainly done in three stages. Data Collection, Data Processing and Data Analysis.


In the first stage i.e, the Data Collection stage, the raw data that was provided was saved under the data_raw folder. This raw data was loaded into the google colab for further processing. In the Data Processing stage, cleaning of the raw data was done and this clean data was saved into clean_data.csv. In the last stage which is the Data Analysis stage, the analysis was performed on this clean_data.csv and the results were captured and saved under the results folder.
